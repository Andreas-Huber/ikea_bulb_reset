# Sonoff Ikea Bulb Resetter

This is a small firmware used to flash on a Sonoff S20. It is used to reset the ikea bulb to pairing mode. I need to reset about 20 bulb and to do this manually sucks.

## Usage:

Clone this repo and flash it to your S20 with your favourite programmer. E.g. I use VS Code with the arduino extension.

Plug it into your wall outlet, long press the button on the front and it will start the reset procedure.
